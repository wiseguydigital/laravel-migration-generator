## Laravel4 Migration Generator

### Generate migrations based on existing tables

Require this package in your composer.json:

    "barryvdh/laravel-migration-generator": "dev-master"

And add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in app/config/app.php

    'Barryvdh\MigrationGenerator\MigrationGeneratorServiceProvider',

You can now generate the migration by running the command, followed by the tables you want to generate

    php artisan migration-generate posts,users

Your migrations will be created in app/database/migrations

#### Handling `enum` fields

If you have `enum` field types then currently [Doctrine Schema Manager](http://docs.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-dbal/en/latest/reference/schema-manager.html) will throw an exception:

    [Doctrine\DBAL\DBALException]                                                                    
    Unknown database type enum requested, Doctrine\DBAL\Platforms\MySqlPlatform may not support it.

You may set the `enum-as-string` option to `true` and Doctrine will then map `enum` types to `string` types e.g.

    php artisan migration-generate posts,users --enum-as-string=true

For now you will need to manually change those enum entries in your migrations files.

Migrations are generated by https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators
This assumes the key is 'id' and timestamps (created_at/updated_at) are generated by default.
